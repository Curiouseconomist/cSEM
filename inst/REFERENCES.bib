  Abstract                 = {Generalized structured component analysis has emerged in marketing and psychometric literature as an alternative to structural equation modeling. A recent simulation study recommends that, in most cases, this analysis is preferable to structural equation modeling because it outperforms the latter when the model is misspecified. This article examines the characteristics of generalized structured component analysis and reveals that the surprising previous findings are attributable to an incomplete experimental design and an error incurred during the software implementation of generalized structured component analysis. Simulated data show that generalized structured component analysis provides inconsistent estimates. In some instances, model misspecification can nearly neutralize this inconsistency, but in others it will reinforce the inconsistency. Moreover, generalized structured component analysis is hardly suitable for mediation analysis because it substantially overestimates the direct effect. Thus, generalized structured component analysis cannot be recommended universally over structural equation modeling.},

is well-known to be inconsistent. The linear compounds of indicators that PLS substitutes for the latent
variables do not obey the equations that the latter satisfy. We propose simple, non-iterative corrections
leading to consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN)-estimators for the loadings and for the correlations
between the latent variables. Moreover, we show how to obtain CAN-estimators for the parameters of
structural recursive systems of equations, containing linear and interaction terms, without the need to
specify a particular joint distribution. If quadratic and higher order terms are included, the approach will
produce CAN-estimators as well when predictor variables and error terms are jointly normal.We compare
the adjusted PLS, denoted by PLSc, with Latent Moderated Structural Equations (LMS), using Monte
Carlo studies and an empirical application.},
