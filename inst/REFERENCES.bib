  comment   = {Partial Least Squares as applied to models with latent variables, measured indirectly by indicators,
is well-known to be inconsistent. The linear compounds of indicators that PLS substitutes for the latent
variables do not obey the equations that the latter satisfy. We propose simple, non-iterative corrections
leading to consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN)-estimators for the loadings and for the correlations
between the latent variables. Moreover, we show how to obtain CAN-estimators for the parameters of
structural recursive systems of equations, containing linear and interaction terms, without the need to
specify a particular joint distribution. If quadratic and higher order terms are included, the approach will
produce CAN-estimators as well when predictor variables and error terms are jointly normal.We compare
the adjusted PLS, denoted by PLSc, with Latent Moderated Structural Equations (LMS), using Monte
Carlo studies and an empirical application.},

A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.},
