# cSEM

WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. BREAKING CHANGES MAY OCCUR. 
         Do not use the package before the first stable relase (which will
         be 0.0.1, towards the end of 2018).

## Purpose

Estimate, analyse, test and study linear and nonlinear structural equation models 
using composite based approaches, procedures and tests including e.g. 
PLS, GSCA, 2SLS estimation and numerous tests.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Currently only a development version from GitHub is available:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("M-E-Steiner/cSEM")
```

## Philopsophy/Goals/Ideas

- Easy to use by non-R experts: 
    - Functions `csem` and `cca` provide default choices for most of its arguments 
      (similarity to the `sem` and `cfa` functions of the [lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) 
      package is intended).
    - Well documented (Vignettes, HTML output, a website, intro course(s)). 
      Of course this may take some time!
    - There will be an extensive (non-expert) visually and didactically appealing 
      documentation designed to make the learning curve of both the methods involved and the package as flat as possible.
    - Structured output/results  that aims to be "easy"" in a sense that it is
          - ... descriptive/verbose
          - ... easy to export to other environments such as MS Word, Latex files etc. (exportability)
          - ... easy to migrate from/to/between other PLS/VB/CB-based systems (lavaan, semPLS, ADANCO, SmartPLS)
                (this will also take a lot of time!)
    - (In the future) Intro courses, accompaning website, cheatsheets.
- The package is designed to be flexible/modular enough so that researchers 
  developing new methods can take specific function provided by the package and 
  alter them according to their need without working their way through a chain
  of other functions (naturally this will not always be possible).
- Modern in a sense that the package integrates modern developments within 
  the R community. This mainly includes ideas/recommendations/design choices that
  fead into the packages of the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).
      
## To do
### Before the initial relase

- Implement:
     - Fixed weights
     - Unit weights
     - All of Kettenring's (1971) criteria for obtaining weights
         - SUMCOR 
         - MAXVAR 
         - SSQCOR 
         - MINVAR
         - GENVAR
     - GSCA  <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gesca/gesca.pdf>
     - 2SLS for linear models but possibly also for non-linear models
- Tests 
    - Test for overall model fit (Dijkstra & Henseler)
    - (bootstrapped) Hausman test (for linear (and non-linear?) models)
- Compute direct, indirect and total effect.
- Allow for bootstrapping (use the `boot` package)/ jackknife?
    - A bootstrap function should accept a user defined function that can be 
      bootstraped with it.
- Allow for different convergence criteria in PLS (as in [matrixpls](https://github.com/mronkko/matrixpls))
- Automatically distinguish between linear and nonlinear models (will be useful
  for performance reasons).
- Use the [crayon package](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) and the 
  [cli package](https://github.com/r-lib/cli) to produce good-looking/colorful 
  console output.
- Use the [spelling package](https://github.com/ropensci/spelling) to
  do spellchecking of the package documentation (just before the release).
- Move the `.PLS_weight_scheme_inner` argument to the `...` arguement list.



  
### At some point ...
  
- Vignettes for all important aspects of the package and the methods used.
- GSCAm 
- Enable cross-PLS-platform use by writting functions that make it
  easy to export and import models/results from/to.
- Factor score path analysis von Ives Rosseel
- Compute effect size, Cohens f2 (Cohen, 1988)
