      <th>.eval_plan</th>

all available cores will be used. Defaults to "<em>sequential</em>".</p></td>

be treated? One of "<em>drop</em>", "<em>ignore</em>", or "<em>replace</em>". If "<em>drop</em>", all
replications/resamples yielding an inadmissible result will be dropped
(i.e. the number of results returned will potentially be less than <code>.R</code>).
For "<em>ignore</em>" all results are returned even if all or some of the replications
yielded inadmissible results (i.e. number of results returned is equal to <code>.R</code>).
For "<em>replace</em>" resampling continues until there are exactly <code>.R</code> admissible solutions.
Depending on the frequency of inadmissible solutions this may significantly increase
computing time. Defaults to "<em>drop</em>".</p></td>

      <td><p>Integer or <code>NULL</code>. The random seed to use. Defaults to <code>NULL</code> in which
case an arbitrary seed is chosen. Note that the scope of the seed is limited
to the body of the function it is used in. Hence, the global seed will
not be altered!</p></td>
