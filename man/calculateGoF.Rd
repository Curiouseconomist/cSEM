\usage{
calculateGoF(
 .object              = NULL,
 .only_common_factors = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.object}{An R object of class \link{cSEMResults} resulting from a call to \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}}.}

\item{.only_common_factors}{Logical. Should only constructs modeled as common
factors be included? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value.
}
\description{
Calculate the Goodness of Fit (GoF) proposed by \insertCite{Tenenhaus2004;textual}{cSEM}.
Note that, contrary to what the name suggests, the GoF is \strong{not} a
measure of model fit in a Chi-square fit test sense. See e.g. \insertCite{Henseler2012a;textual}{cSEM}
for a discussion.
}
\details{
The GoF is inherently tied to the common factor model. It is therefore
unclear how to meaningfully interpret the GoF in the context of a
composite model. Hence, only constructs modeled as common factors are
considered. It is possible to force computation of the GoF including constructs
modeled as composites as well by setting \code{.only_common_factors = FALSE},
however, we explicitly discourage to do so as the result may not even
have a conceptual meaning.

The function is only applicable to objects of class \code{cSEMResults_default}.
For other object classes use \code{\link[=assess]{assess()}}.
