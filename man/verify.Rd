\title{Verify admissibility}
\usage{
verify(.object)
}
\arguments{
\item{.object}{An R object of class \link{cSEMResults} resulting from a call to \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}}.}
}
\value{
A logical vector indicating which (if any) problem occurred.
A \code{FALSE} indicates that the specific problem has not occured. For models containg second order
constructs estimated by a two stage approach a list of two such vectors
(one for the first and one for the second stage) is returned. Status codes are:
\itemize{
\item 1: The algorithm has converged.
\item 2: All absolute standardized loading estimates are smaller than or equal to 1.
A violation implies either a negative variance of the measurement error or
\item 3: The construct VCV is positive semi-definite.
\item 4: All reliability estimates are smaller than or equal to 1.
\item 5: The model-implied indicator VCV is positive semi-definite.
This is only checked for linear models (including models containing
second-order constructs).
}
}
\description{
Verify admissibility of the estimated quantities in \code{.object}.
}
\details{
Results exhibiting one of the following defects are deemed inadmissible:
non-convergence of the algorithm used to obtain weights, loadings and/or
(congeneric) reliabilities larger than 1, a construct variance-covariance (VCV) and/or
model-implied VCV matrix that is not positive semi-definite.

If the two stage approach was used for models containing second order
constructs, both the first and the second stage are checked separately.

Currently, a model-implied indicator VCV matrix for nonlinear model is not
available. \code{verify()} therefore skips the check for positive definitness of the
model-implied indicator VCV matrix for nonlinear models and returns "ok".
