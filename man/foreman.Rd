\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{data.frame} or a \code{matrix} of standardized or unstandarized data.
Possible column types or classes of the data provided are: logical,
numeric (double or integer), factor (ordered and unordered)
or a mix of several types. The data may also include
\emph{one} character column whose column name must be given to \code{.id}.
This column is assumed to contain group identifiers used to split
the data into groups.}

\item{.model}{A model in \link[lavaan:model.syntax]{lavaan model syntax}
or a \link{cSEMModel} list.}

\item{.approach_cor_robust}{Character string. Approach used to obtain a robust
indicator correlation matrix. One of: "\emph{none}" in which case the standard
bravais-person correlation is used,
"\emph{spearman}" for the spearman correlation, or
"\emph{mcd}" via \code{\link[MASS:cov.rob]{MASS::cov.rob()}} for a robust correlation matrix.
Defaults to "\emph{none}".}

\item{.approach_nl}{Character string. Approach used to estimate nonlinear
structural relationships. One of: "\emph{sequential}" or "\emph{replace}".
Defaults to "\emph{sequential}".}

\item{.approach_paths}{Character string. Approach used to estimate the
structural coefficients. One of: "\emph{OLS}" or "\emph{2SLS}" (not yet implemented).
Defaults to "\emph{OLS}".}

\item{.approach_weights}{Character string. Approach used to
obtain composite weights. One of: "\emph{PLS-PM}", "\emph{SUMCORR}", "\emph{MAXVAR}",
"\emph{SSQCORR}", "\emph{MINVAR}", "\emph{GENVAR}", "\emph{GSCA}", "\emph{PCA}", "\emph{unit}", "\emph{bartlett}",
or "\emph{regression}".
Defaults to "\emph{PLS-PM}".}

\item{.conv_criterion}{Character string. The criterion to use for the convergence check.
One of: "\emph{diff_absolute}", "\emph{diff_squared}", or "\emph{diff_relative}". Defaults
to "\emph{diff_absolute}".}

\item{.disattenuate}{Logical. Should composite/proxy correlations
be disattenuated to yield consisten loadings and path estimates if at least
one of the construct is modeled as a common factor? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{.dominant_indicators}{A character vector of \code{"name" = "value"} pairs,
where \code{"value"} is a character string giving the name of the dominant indicator
and \code{"name"} a character string of the corresponding construct name.
Dominant indicators may be specified for a subset of the constructs.}

\item{.estimate_structural}{Logical. Should the structural coefficients
be estimated? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{.id}{Character string or integer. The name or position of the column of
\code{.data} used to split the data into groups.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{.iter_max}{Integer. The maximum number of iterations allowed.
If \code{iter_max = 1} and \code{.approach_weights = "PLS-PM"} one-step weights are returned.
If the algorithm exceeds the specified number, weights of iteration step
\code{.iter_max - 1}  will be returned with a warning. Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{.normality}{Logical. Should joint normality of
\eqn{[\eta_{1:p}; \zeta; \epsilon]}{[\eta_(1:p); \zeta; \epsilon]}
be assumed in the nonlinear model? See \insertCite{Dijkstra2014}{cSEM} for details.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Ignored if the model is linear.}

\item{.PLS_approach_cf}{Character string. Approach used to obtain the correction
factors for PLSc. One of: "\emph{dist_squared_euclid}", "\emph{dist_euclid_weighted}",
"\emph{fisher_transformed}", "\emph{mean_arithmetic}", "\emph{mean_geometric}", "\emph{mean_harmonic}",
"\emph{geo_of_harmonic}". Defaults to "\emph{dist_squared_euclid}".
Ignored if \code{.disattenuate = FALSE} or if \code{.approach_weights} is not PLS-PM.}

\item{.PLS_ignore_structural_model}{Logical. Should the structural model be ignored
when calculating the inner weights of the PLS-PM algorithm? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Ignored if \code{.approach_weights} is not PLS-PM.}

\item{.PLS_modes}{Either a named list specifying the mode that should be used for
each construct in the form \code{"name" = "mode"}, a single character
string giving the mode that should be used for all constructs, or \code{NULL}.
Possible choices for \code{"mode"} are: "\emph{modeA}", "\emph{modeB}", "\emph{modeBNNLS}", "\emph{unit}", a single number (weight) or
a vector of fixed weights of the same length as there are indicators for the
construct given by \code{"name"}. If only a single number is provided this is identical to
using unit weights, as weights are rescaled such that the related composite
has unit variance.  Defaults to \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL} the appropriate mode according to the type
of construct used is choosen. Ignored if \code{.approach_weight} is not PLS-PM.}

\item{.PLS_weight_scheme_inner}{Character string. The inner weighting scheme
used in PLS-PM. One of: "\emph{centroid}", "\emph{factorial}", or "\emph{path}".
Defaults to "\emph{path}". Ignored if \code{.approach_weight} is not PLS-PM.}

\item{.reliabilities}{A character vector of \code{"name" = value} pairs,
where \code{value} is a number between 0 and 1 and \code{"name"} a character string
of the corresponding construct name, or \code{NULL}. Reliabilities
may be given for a subset of the constructs. Defaults to \code{NULL} in which case
reliabilities are estimated by \code{csem()}. Currently, only supported for
\code{.approach_weights = "PLS-PM"}.}

\item{.tolerance}{Double. The tolerance criterion for convergence.
Defaults to \code{1e-05}.}

\item{.starting_values}{list of named vectors containig the starting values.
Defaults to "\emph{NULL}".}

\description{
The central hub of the \code{cSEM} package. It acts like a
foreman by collecting all (estimation) tasks, distributing them to lower
level package functions, and eventually recollecting all of their results.
It is called by \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}} to manage the actual calculations.
It may be called directly by the user, however, in most cases it will likely
be more convenient to use \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}} instead.
