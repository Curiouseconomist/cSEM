\details{
The function is essentially a wrapper around a number of internal functions
that perform an "assessment task" (called a \strong{quality criterion} in \pkg{cSEM}
parlance) like computing the (congeneric) reliability,
the effect size, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) etc.

By default every possible quality criterion is calculated (\code{.quality_criterion = "all"}).
If only a subset of quality criteria needs to be computed a single character string
or a vector of character strings naming the quantity to compute may be
supplied to \code{assess()} via the \code{.quality_criterion} argument. Currently, the
following quality crieria are implemented (in alphabetical order):
\describe{
\item{Average variance extracted (AVE)]; "ave"}{An estimate of the
amount of variation in the indicators that is due to the assumed latent variable.
Practically, it is calculated as the ratio of the (indicator) true score variances
(i.e., the sum of the squared loadings)
relative to the sum of the total indicator variances.}
\item{Congeneric reliability; "rho_C"}{An estimate of the
reliability assuming a congeneric measurement model (i.e., loadings are
allowed to differ) and a test score (proxy) based on unit weights.
To compute the congeneric reliability based on a score that uses the weights of the
weight approach used to obtain \code{.object} use \code{"rho_C_weighted"} instead.
Congeneric reliability is the unified name for
reliability estimates that assume a congeneric measurement model.
Alternative but synonemmous names for \code{"rho_C"} are:
composite reliability, construct reliablity, reliability coefficient,
JÃ¶reskog's rho, coefficient omega, or Dillon-Goldstein's rho.
For \code{"rho_C_weighted"}: rho_A, or rho_B.}
\item{Cronbach's alpha; "cronbachs_alpha"}{An estimate of the
reliability assuming a tau-equivalent measurement model (i.e., a measurement
model with equal loadings) and a test score (proxy) based on unit weights.
To compute Cronbach's alpha based on a score that uses the weights of the
weight approach used to obtain \code{.object} use \code{"cronbachs_alpha_weighted"} instead.
Cronbach's alpha is an alias for \code{"rho_T"} (the tau-equivalent
reliability) which is
the prefered name for this kind of reliability in \pkg{cSEM}, as it clearly states what
it actually estimates (the tau-equivalent reliability as opposed to
the congeneric reliability). "rho_T" and "cronbachs_alpha" are therefore
always identical.}
\item{Distance measures; "dg", "dl", "dml"}{Measures of the distance
between the model-implied and the empirical indicator correlation matrix.
Currently, the geodesic distance (\code{"dg"}), the squared Euclidian distance
(\code{"dl"}) and the the maximum likelihood-based distance function are implemented
(\code{"dml"}).}
\item{Effect size; "esize"}{An index of the effect size of an independent
variable in a structural regression equation. The effect size of the k'th
independent variable in this case
is definied as the ratio (R2_included - R2_excluded)/(1 - R2_included), where
R2_inclded and R2_excluded are the R squares of the
original structural model regression equation (R2_included) and the
alternative speficication with the k'th variable dropped (R2_excluded).}
\item{Fornell-Larcker criterion; "fl"}{An estimate of the
convergent and/or discriminant validity of a construct. The Fornell-Larcker
criterion is a decision rule based on a comparison between the squared
construct correlations and the average variance extracted. FL returns
a matrix with the squared construct correlations on the off-diagonal and
the AVE's on the main diagonal.}
\item{Goodness of Fit (GoF); "gof"}{The GoF is defined as the square root of the mean
of the R squares of the structural model times the mean of the variances in the indicators
that are explained by their related constructs (i.e., the average over all lambda^2_k).
For the latter, only constructs modeled as common factors are considered
as they explain their indicator variance in contrast to a composite where
indicators actually build the construct.
Note that, contrary to what the name suggests, the GoF is \strong{not} a
measure of model fit in a Chi-square fit test sense.}
\item{Heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT); "htmt"}{An estimate of the
convergent and/or discriminant validity of a construct.}
\item{R square and R square adjusted; "r2", "r2_adj"}{The R square and the adjusted
R square for each structural regression equation.}
\item{Redundancy analysis (RA); "ra"}{The process of regressing the scores
of a reflectively measured construct on the scores of a formatively measured
construct in order to gain empirical evidence for convergent validity of a
formatively measured construct.
RA is therefore confined to PLS, specifically PLS with at least one construct
whose mode is Mode B. This is the case if the construct is modeled as a
composite or if the construct was explicitly given Mode B.
Hence RA is only conducated if \code{.object} was obtained using
\code{.approach_weights = "PLS-PM"} and if at least one constructs mode is Mode B.}
\item{Standardized root mean square residual; "srmr"}{The square root of the
average elementwise squared distance between elements of the model-implied
and the empirical indicator corrleation matrix.}
\item{Tau-equivalent reliability; "rho_T"}{An estimate of the
reliability assuming a tau-equivalent measurement model (i.e. a measurement
model with equal loadings) and a test score (proxy) based on unit weights.
Tau-equivalent reliability is the preferred name for reliability estimates
that assume a tau-equivalent measurment model such as Cronbach's alpha.}
\item{Variance inflation factors (VIF); "vif"}{An index for the amount of (multi-)
collinearity between independent variables of a regression equation. Computed
for each structural equation. Practically, VIF_k is defined
as the ratio of 1 over (1 - R2_k) where R2_k is the R squared from a regression
of the k'th independent variable on all remaining independent variables.}
\item{Variance inflation factors for PLS-PM mode B (VIF-ModeB); "vifmodeB"}{An index for
the amount of (multi-) collinearity between independent variables (indicators) in
mode B regression equations. Computed only if \code{.object} was obtained using
\code{.weight_approach = "PLS-PM"} and at least one mode was mode B.
Practically, VIF-ModeB_k is defined as the ratio of 1 over (1 - R2_k) where
R2_k is the R squared from a regression of the k'th indicator of block j on
all remaining indicators of the same block.}

For details on all quality criteria see the \href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/articles/Using-assess.html#methods}{Methods and Formulae} section
of the \href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/articles/Using-assess.html}{Postestimation: Assessing a model}
article on the on the
\href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/index.html}{cSEM website}.

Some of the quality criteria are inherently tied to the classical common
factor model and therefore only meaningfully interpreted within a common
factor model (see the
\href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/articles/Using-assess.html}{Postestimation: Assessing a model}
article for details).
It is possible to force computation of all quality criteria for constructs
modeled as composites by setting \code{.only_common_factors = FALSE}, however,
we explicitly warn to interpret quality criteria in this case with caution,
as they may not even have a conceptual meaning.

\subsection{Resampling}{
To resample a given quality criterion supply the name of the function
that calculates the desired quality criterion to \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}}'s \code{.user_funs} argument.
