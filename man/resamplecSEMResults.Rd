\usage{
resampleResults(
 .object        = args_default()$.object,
 .data          = NULL,
 .method        = c("bootstrap", "jackknife", "permutation", "cross-validation"),
 .R         = 499,
 .id            = NULL,
 .cv_folds      = 10      
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.object}{An R object of class \code{cSEM<class>} with corresponding method.}

\item{.method}{Character string. The resampling method to use. One of:
"\emph{bootstrap}" or "\emph{jackknife}". Defaults to "\emph{bootstrap}".}

\item{.R}{Integer. The number of bootstrap or permuation replications
to use. Defaults to \code{499}.}

\item{.handle_inadmissibles}{Character string. How should inadmissible results
be treated? One of "\emph{drop}", "\emph{ignore}", or "\emph{replace}". If "\emph{drop}", all
replications/resamples yielding an inadmissible result will be dropped (
number of results shown <= .R). For "\emph{ignore}" all results are returned
even if they are inadmissible (number of results = .R). For "\emph{replace}"
resampling continues until there are exactly .R admissible solutions.
Defaults to "\emph{drop}".}

\item{.verbose}{Logical. Should information be printed to the console? Defaults
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{.user_funs}{A function or a (named) list of functions to apply to every
resample. Takes \code{.object} as an input:
\code{myFun <- function(.object) {...}}.  Output should preferably be a (named)
vector but matrices are also accepted. Note however that output will be
vectorized (columnwise) in this case.}

\item{.R2}{Integer. The number of bootstrap replications to use when
resampling from a resample. Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{.handle_inadmissibles2}{Character string. How should inadmissible results
be treated when resampling from a resample? For details see
the description for \code{.handle_inadmissibles}.}

\item{.method2}{Character string. The resampling method to use when resampling
from a resample. One of: "\emph{none}", "\emph{bootstrap}", "\emph{jackknife}" or "\emph{both}"
in which case bootstrap and jackknife samples are drawn. For the former
the number of bootstrap draws may be provided via \code{.R2}.
Option "\emph{both}" is necessary if both tStat and Bca confidence intervalls
are needed. Naturally, choosing "\emph{both}" this is very time consuming as the
number of replicats is now \code{.R * (.R2 + n)} if \code{.method = "bootstrap"} or
\code{n * (.R2 + n)} if \code{.method = "jackknife"}. Defaults to "\emph{none}".}
