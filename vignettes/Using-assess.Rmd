# Introduction

As indicated by the name, `assess()` is used to assess a model estimated using the
`csem()` function.

In `cSEM` *model assessement* is considered to be any task that in some way or
another seeks to assess the quality of the estimated model *without conducting* 
*a statistical test* (tests are covered by the `test_*` family of functions). Quality in this case is taken to be a catch-all term for
all common aspects of model assessment. This mainly comprises
fit indices, reliability estimates, common validity assessment criteria and other 
related quality measures/indices that do not rely on a formal test procedure. Hereinafter, 
we will refer to a generic (fit) index, criteria or assessment measure as 
a **quality measure**.
Currently the following quality measures are implemented:

- Convergent and discriminant validity assessment:
    - The **average variance extracted** (AVE) (the basis for the 
      Fornell-Larcker criteria (FSE))
    - The **heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations** (HTMT)
- **Congeneric reliability** ($\rho_C$), also known as e.g.: composite reliability,
  construct reliability, (unidimensional) omega, JÃ¶reskog's $\rho$, $\rho_A$,
  or $\rho_B$. 
- **Tau-equivalent reliability** ($\rho_T$), also known as e.g.: Cronbach alpha, alpha, $\alpha$,
  coefficient alpha, Guttman's $\lambda_3$, KR-20. 
  
  A third reliability measure is **Parallel reliability** ($\rho_P$), also known
  as e.g.: split-half reliability, 
  Spearman-Brown formulae/prophecy, standarized alpha. In `cSEM` parallel 
  reliability is always identical to tau-equivalent reliability as indicators
  are always standardized. Hence, only $\rho_T$ is reported.
- Distance measures
    - The **standardized root mean square residual** (SRMR)
    - The **geodesic distance** (DG)
    - The **squared Euclidian distance** (DL)
    - The **maximum-likelihood distance** (DML)
- The **variance inflation factors** (VIF)
- The (adjusted) coefficient of determination ($R^2$ and $R^2_{adj}$)
- A measure of the **effect size**
- **Redundancy analysis** (RA)


For implementation details see the [Methods & Formulae](#methods) section.

## Syntax & Options

```{r eval=FALSE}
assess(
  .object              = NULL,
  .what                = c("all", "ave", "rhoP", "rhoT", "rhoC", "HTMT", 
                           "SRMR", "RMSEA")
  .only_common_factors = TRUE
)
```

`.object`

:  An object of class `cSEMResults` resulting from a call to `csem()`. Note
   that, technically, a call to `csem()` results in an object with at least
   two class attributes. 
   The first class attribute is always `cSEMResults`. The second depends on the 
   estimated model and/or the type of data provided. Technically, method dispatch 
   is based on the second class attribute, however, practically this does not 
   affect how the function is used. See the [Details](#details) section below.
   
`.what`

:  A character string or a vector of character strings naming the quality measure 
   to compute. By default all quality measures are computed (`"all"`).
  
`.only_common_factors`

:  Logical. Should quality measures be calculated for constructs modeled as 
   common factors only? Defaults to `TRUE`. See the [Details](#details) section 
   below.

## Details {#details}

In line with all of `cSEM`'s postestimation functions, `assess()` is a generic 
function with methods for objects of class `cSEMResults_default`, 
`cSEMResults_multi`, `cSEMResults_2ndorder`. In `cSEM`
every `cSEMResults_*` object must also have class `cSEMResults` for internal reasons. 
When using one of the major postestimation functions, method dispatch is therefore technically
done on one of the `cSEMResults_*` class attributes, ignoring the 
`cSEMResults` class attribute. As long as `assess()` is
used directly method dispatch is not of any practical concern to the end-user. The difference, however,
becomes important if a user seeks to directly invoke an internal function 
which is called by `assess() ` (e.g., `calculateAVE()` or `calculateHTMT()`). 
In this case only objects of class `cSEMResults_default` are accepted as this
ensures a specific structure. Therefore, it is important to remember that
*internal functions are generally **not** generic.*

Some assessment measures are inherently tied to the common factor model. It
is therefore unclear how to interpret their results in the context of a 
composite model. Consequently, their computation is suppressed by default for 
constructs modeled as common factors. Currently, this applies to the following
quality measures: 

- AVE and validity assessment based theron (i.e., the Fornell-Larcker criterion)
- HTMT and validity assessment based theron
- All reliability measures (congeneric, tau-equivalen, and parallel)
 
It is possible to force computation of all quality measures for constructs
modeled as composites, however, we explicitly warn to interpret results with
caution, as they may not even have a conceptual meaning.

All quality measures assume that the estimated loadings, construct correlations 
and path coefficients involved in the computation of a specific qualitiy measure
are consistent estimates for their theoretical population counterpart. If
the user deliberately chooses an approach that yields inconsistent estimates (by
setting `.disattenuate = FALSE` in `csem()` when the model contains constructs
modeled as common factors) `assess()` will still estimate
all quantities, however, a warning is displayed as quantities such as
the AVE or the congeneric reliability $\rho_C$ inherit inconsistency making their 
interpretation at the very least dubious.


# Usage & Examples

## Example 1 {#example1}

# Methods & Formulae {#methods}

This section provides technical details and relevant formulae. 

Define the general measurement model as:
$$ x_{kj} = \eta_{kj} + \varepsilon_{kj} = \lambda_{kj}\eta_j +  \varepsilon_{kj}\quad\text{for}\quad k = 1, \dots, K_j\quad\text{and}\quad j = 1, \dots, J$$

Call $\eta_{jk} = \lambda_{jk}\eta_j$ the true score and $\eta_j$ the underlying latent variable
supposed to be the common factor or cause for the $K_j$ indicators conntected to latent variable $\eta_j$. 
Call $\lambda_{kj}$ the loading or direct effect of the latent variable on its indicator.
Let $x_{kj}$ be an indicator, $\varepsilon_{kj}$ be a measurement error and  
$$\hat{\eta}_j = \sum^{K_j}_{k = 1} w_{kj} x_{kj} = \sum^{K_j}_{k = 1} w_{kj} \eta_{kj} + \sum^{K_j}_{k = 1} w_{kj} \varepsilon_{kj}
= \bar\eta_{kj} + \bar\varepsilon_{kj}$$ 
be a proxy/test score/composite/stand-in for $\eta_j$, where $w_{kj}$ is a weight and
$\bar\eta_k$ a population proxy, i.e., a weight sum of true scores. 
We will refer to $\hat\eta$ as "proxy" below as it best reflects its intended use.

Assume that $E(\varepsilon_{kj}) = E(\eta_j) = Cov(\eta_j, \varepsilon_{kj}) = 0$.
Further assume $Cov(\varepsilon_{kj}, \varepsilon_{lj})=0$ for $k \neq l$
and that $Var(\eta_j) = E(\eta^2_j) = 1$ to determine the scale. 

Treatment below is done for a generic true score $\eta_{jk}$. For the sake of
clarity the index $j$ is therefore dropped unless it is necessary to avoid confusion. 

Note that classical treatment of reliability and other measures below is typically
done assuming the proxy $\hat\eta_j$ is a simple sum score which implies that all weighs
are set to one. The treatmeant below is more general since $\hat{\eta}_j$ is
allowed to be *any* weighted sum of related indicators. Readers familiar with
the "classical treatment" may simply set weights to one (unit weights)
to "translate" results to known formulae.

Based on the assumptions and definitions above the following quantities necessarily follow:

\begin{align}
Cov(x_k, \eta) &= \lambda_k \\
Cor(x_k, \eta) &= \rho_{x_k, \eta} = \frac{\lambda_k}{\sqrt{Var(x_k)}} \\
Var(\eta_k) &= \lambda^2_k \\
Var(x_k)    &= \lambda^2_k + Var(\varepsilon_k) \\
Cov(\eta_k, \eta_l) &= E(\eta_k\eta_l) = \lambda_k\lambda_lE(\eta^2) = \lambda_k\lambda_l \\
Cov(x_k, x_j) &= \lambda_k\lambda_lE(\eta^2) + \lambda_kE(\eta\varepsilon_k) + \lambda_lE(\eta\varepsilon_l) + E(\varepsilon_k\varepsilon_l) = \lambda_k\lambda_l \\
Var(\hat\eta) &= \sum w_k^2(\lambda^2_k + Var(e_k)) + 2\sum_{k < l} w_k w_l \lambda_k\lambda_j = \mathbf{w}'\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{w} \\
Var(\bar\eta) &= \sum w_k^2\lambda^2_k + 2\sum_{k < l} w_k w_l \lambda_k\lambda_j =(\sum w_k\lambda_k)^2 = (\mathbf{w}'\mathbf{\lambda})^2 \\
Cov(\eta, \hat\eta) &= E(\sum w_k \lambda_k \eta^2) = \sum w_k\lambda_k = \mathbf{w}'\mathbf{\lambda}= \sqrt{Var(\bar\eta)}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf\Sigma$ is the indicator variance covariance matrix implied by the 
measurement model:

$$
\mathbf\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda^2_1 + Var(\varepsilon_1) & \lambda_1\lambda_2  & \dots & \lambda_1\lambda_K \\
\lambda_2\lambda_ 1 & \lambda^2_2 + Var(\varepsilon_2) & \dots & \lambda_2\lambda_K \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\lambda_{K}\lambda_1 & \lambda_K\lambda_2 &\dots &\lambda^2_K + Var(\varepsilon_K)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

In `cSEM` indicators are always standardized (i.e., $Var(x_k) = 1$) and weights are always appropriately
scaled such that the variance of $\hat\eta$ is equal to one! For most of the
formulae below this implies a significant simplification, however, for ease of 
comparison to extant literature formulae will be derived and written in
general form. The "simplified form" or "cSEM form" using $Var(x_k) = Var(\hat\eta) = 1$ 
will be given at the end of each paragraph.

## Average variance extracted (AVE)
### Definition
Several definitions exist. For ease of comparison to extant literature the most 
common definitions are given below:

- The AVE is the share of the total indicator variance that is
  captured by the proxy. 
- The AVE is the ratio of the sum of the true score variances (explained variation) relative to the 
  sum of the total indicator variances (total variation).
- The AVE gauges how much of the variation in the indicators is due to the 
  assumed latent variable. Consequently, the share of unexplained, 
  i.e. error variation is 1 - AVE.
- Since the $R^2_k$ from a regression of $x_k$ on $\eta$ is equal to the
  share of the explained variation relative to the share of total variation,
  the AVE is a sum over all $R^2_k$. 

It is important to stress that, although different in wording, all definitions 
are synonymous! 

### Formula
Using the results and notation derived above, the AVE for a generic construct is:
$$ AVE = \frac{\sum Var(\eta_k)}{\sum Var(x_k)} = \frac{\sum\lambda^2_k}{\sum(\lambda^2_k + Var(\varepsilon_k))}$$
If $x_k$ is standardized the denominator reduces to $K$ and the AVE is 
$$ AVE = \frac{1}{K}\sum \lambda^2_k = \frac{1}{K}\sum \rho_{x_k, \eta}^2$$
As an important consequence, the AVE is closely tied the communality.
**Indicator communality** ($COM_k$) is definied as the square of the standardized loading of the $k$'th
indicator ($\lambda^2$). **Construct (total) communality** ($COM = \varnothing COM_k$) is definied as the
mean over all indicator communalities. Since indicators, proxies and 
subsequently loadings are always standardized, the squared loading is simply 
the squared correlation between the indicator and its related population proxy. 
The AVE is also directly related to another frequently used term, **indicator reliability**, 
defined as the squared correlation between an indicator $k$ and its related 
population proxy (see section [Reliability](#reliability) below),
which is again simply $\lambda^2$. Therefore in `cSEM` we always have:

$$ AVE = COM = \frac{1}{K}\sum COM_k = \frac{1}{K}\sum \text{Indicator reliability}_k = \frac{1}{K}\sum R^2_k $$

### Implementation
The function is implemented as: `calculateAVE()`. See `?calculateAVE ` for a list
of arguments and their description.

The AVE is the basis for the Fornell-Larcker criterion. See (TODO).

## Reliability {#reliability}

### Definition
Reliability is the **consistency of measurement**, i.e. the degree to which a hypothetical
repetition of the same measure would yield the same results. As such, reliability
is the closeness of a measure to an error free measure. It is not to be confused 
with validity as a perfectly reliable measure may be completely invalid.

Practically, reliability must be empirically assessed based on a theoretical
framework. The dominant - and virtually only - theoretical framework against which 
to compare empirical reliability results to is the well-known true score framework 
which provides the underlying justification for the measurement model postulated at the beginning
of the [Methods & Formulae](#methods) section. Based on the true score framework
reliability is defined as

1. The amount of population proxy variance, $Var(\bar\eta)$, relative to the proxy variance, $Var(\hat\eta)$.
2. This is identical to the squared correlation between the true score and the
   proxy: $\rho_{\eta, \hat\eta}^2 = Cor(\eta, \hat\eta)^2$.

This "kind" of reliability is commonly referred to as 
**internal consistency reliability**.

Based on the true score theory three major types of measurement models are 
distinguished. Each type implies different assumptions which give rise
to the formulae written below. The well-established names for the different 
types of measurement model provide natural naming candidates for their corresponding
reliabilities measure:

1. **Parallel** -- Assumption: $\eta_k = \eta \longrightarrow \lambda_k = \lambda$ and $Var(\varepsilon_k) = Var(\varepsilon)$.
1. **Tau-equivalent** -- Assumption: $\eta_k = \eta \longrightarrow \lambda_k = \lambda$ and $Var(\varepsilon_k) \neq Var(\varepsilon_l)$.
1. **Congeneric** -- Assumption: $\eta_k = \lambda_k\eta$ and $Var(\varepsilon_k) \neq Var(\varepsilon_l)$.


### Formula

The most general formula for reliability is the congeneric reliability:

**Congeneric reliability**
$$ \rho_C = \frac{Var(\bar\eta)}{Var(\hat\eta_k)} = \frac{(\mathbf{w}'\mathbf{\lambda})^2}{\mathbf{w}'\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{w}}$$
Using the assumptions imposed by the tau-equivalent measurement model we obtain
the tau-equivalent reliability.

**Tau-equivalent reliability**
$$ \rho_T = \frac{\lambda^2(\sum w_k)^2}{\lambda^2(\sum w_k)^2 + \sum w_k^2Var(\varepsilon_k)}
 = \frac{\bar\sigma_x(\sum w_k)^2}{\bar\sigma_x[(\sum w_k)^2 - \sum w_k^2] + \sum w_k^2Var(x_k)}$$
where we used the fact that if $\lambda_k = \lambda$ (tau-equivalence), 
$\lambda^2_k$ equals the average covariance between indicators:
 $$\bar\sigma_x = \frac{1}{K(K-1)}\sum^K_{k=1}\sum^K_{l=1} \sigma_{kl}$$

Using the assumptions imposed by the parallel measurement model we obtain
the parallel reliability:

**Parallel reliability**
$$ \rho_P = \frac{\lambda^2(\sum w_k)^2}{\lambda^2(\sum w_k)^2 + Var(\varepsilon)\sum w_k^2} = 
 \frac{\bar\sigma_x(\sum w_k)^2}{\bar\sigma_x[(\sum w_k)^2 - \sum w_k^2] + Var(x)\sum w_k^2} $$

In `cSEM` indicators are always standardized and weights are choosen such 
that $Var(\hat\eta_k) = 1$. This significantly simplifies the formulae and 
$\rho_T = \rho_P$ are in fact identical:

\begin{align}
\rho_C &=  (\sum w_k\lambda_k)^2 = (\mathbf{w}'\mathbf{\lambda})^2\\
\rho_T = \rho_P &=  \bar\rho_x(\sum w_k)^2
\end{align}

where $\bar\rho_x$ is the average correlation between indicators. Consequently,
parallel and tau-equivalent reliability are always identical in `cSEM`.

It is important to realize that $\rho_T$ ($\rho_P$) based on the average covariance/
correlation (if $x_k$ is standardized as it is always the case in `cSEM`) are nested within the 
general formula, however, **if and only if the assumptions of the tau-equivalent
and/or the parallel model hold do they represent reliability measures!!**
In pratice, these assumptions are unlikely to hold. We therefore explicitly discourage
their use as congeneric reliability is virtually always preferable in empirical
work! In fact, as shown above, congeneric reliability is identical to the 
tau-equivalent/parallel reliability *if their respective assumptions actually hold*,
essentially offering robustness against violation of the tau-equivalence and/or
parallel measurement assumption.

#### Confidence interval

Trinchera et al. (2018) proposed a closed-form confidence interval (CI) for
the tau-equivalent reliability (coefficient alpha). To compute the CI, set
`.calculate_ci = TRUE` when calling `assess()` or invoke 
`calculateRhoT(..., .calculate_ci = TRUE)` directly. The level of the CI
can be changed by supplying a single value or a vector of values to $.alpha$.

#### A note on the terminology

A vast bulk of literature dating back to seminal work by Spearman (e.g., Spearman (1904))
has been written on the subject of reliability. Inevitably, definitions, formulae, 
notation and terminology conventions are unsystematic and confusing. This is 
particularly true for newcomers to structural equation modeling 
or applied users whose primary concern is to apply the appropriate method 
to the appropriate case without poring over books and research papers
to understand each intricate detail.

In `cSEM` we seek to make working with reliabilities as consistent and easy as
possible by relying on a paper by Cho (2016) who proposed, uniform 
formula-generating methods and a systematic naming conventions for all
common reliability measures. Naturally, some of the conventional terminonolgy 
is deeply entrenched within the nomenclatura of a particular filed (e.g., coefficient
alpha alias Cronbach alpha in pychonometrics) such that a new, albeit consistent,
naming scheme seems superfluous at best. However, we belief the merit of a 
"standardized" naming pattern will eventually be helpful to all users as it
helps clarify potential missconceptions thus preventing potential missue, such as
the (ab)use of Cronbach alpha as a reliability measure for congernic measurement models.

Apart from these considerations, this package takes a pragmatic stance
in a sense that we use consistent naming because it naturally provides
a consistent naming scheme for the functions and the systematic formula generating
methods because they make code maintenance easier. Eventually, what matters is 
the formula and more so its correct application. To facilitate the translation between
different naming systems and conventions we provide a "translation table" below:
