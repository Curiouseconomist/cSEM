#### Common factor

A common factor or latent variable is a type of construct. The defining feature of a
common factor is the idea that the common factor is the common underlying 
(latent) cause of the realizations of a set of indicators that are said to measure 
the common factor. The common factor model is also referred to as 
reflective measurement model. Accordingly, indicators related to the common factor
are modeled as measurement error-prone manifestations of a common variable, 
cause or factor. The idea of a common factor is closely related to the true
score theory. Although, there a subtle conceptional differences, the terms common factor,
true score, and latent variable are mostly used synommenoulsy in **cSEM**.

#### Composite

A composite is a weighted sum of indicators. Composites may 
either serve as constructs in their own right or as proxies for a latent variable. 
The nature of the composite is therefore defined by the type of (measurement) 
model. If composites are error-free representations 
of a concept we refer to the measurement model as composite measurement. If 
composites are used as stand-ins, the measurement model is called 
causal-formative (Henseler, 2017). 
    
#### Composite-based methods 

Composite-based methods or composite-based SEM refers to the entirety of methods 
centered around the use as of composites (linear compounts of observables) 
as stand-ins or error-free representations for the concepts under investigation.
Composite-based methods are also called
variance-based methods as focal parameters are usually retrived such that explained 
variance is maximized.
    
#### Concept

An entity defined by a conceptual/theoretical definition. In line with Rigdon (2016)
variables representing or subsuming a concept are called **conceptual variables**. 
The precise nature/meaning of a conceptual variable depends on 
"differnt assumptions, philosophies or worldviews [of the researcher]" 
(Rigdon, 2016, p. 2). Unless otherwise stated, in **cSEM**, it is sufficient
to think of concepts as entities that exist simply because they 
have been defined. Hence, abstract terms such as "loyalty" or "depression" as 
well as designed entities (artifacts) such as the "OECD Better Life Index"
are covered by the definition.

#### Construct

Construct refer to a representation of a concept *within a given statistical 
model*. While a concept is defined by a conceptual (theoretical) definition, 
a construct for a concept is defined/created by the researcher's operationalization
of a concept within a statistical model. concepts are either modeled
as common factors/latent variables or as composites. Both operationalizations
- the common factor and the composite - are called constructs in **cSEM** .
As opposed to concepts, constructs therefore exist because they arise as 
the result of the act of modeling their relation to the observable 
variables (indicators) based on a specific set of assumptions. 
Constructs may therefore best be understood as stand-ins for concepts. Consequently,
constructs do not necessarily represent the concept they seek to represent.

#### Factor-based methods 

Factor-based methods or factor-based SEM refers to the entirety of methods 
centered around the use of the common factors/latent variables as stand-ins for 
the concepts under investigation. Factor-based methods are also called
covariance-based methods as focal parameters are retrived such that the
difference between the model-implied $\bm\Sigma(\theta)$ and the empirical indicator covariance 
matrix $\bm S$ is minimized.
    
#### Indicator

An observable variable. In **cSEM** observable variables are generally refered 
to as indicators, however, terms such as item, manifest variable, or 
observables are sometimes used synommenoulsy.
    
#### Latent variable

See: Common factor

#### Test score

A proxy for a true score. Usually, the test score is a simple (unweighted) 
sum score of observables/indicators, i.e. unit weights are assumed when
building the test score. More generally, 
the test score can be any weighted sum of observables (i.e. a composite), 
however, the term "test score" is historically closely tied to the idea that it is
indeed a simple sum score. Hence, whenever it is important to distinguish
between a true score as representing a sum score and a true score
as representing a weighted sum of indicators (where indicator weights a not necessarily
one) we will explicitly state what kind of test score we mean.
    
#### True score

The term true score derives from the true score theory which theorizes/models
an outcome/indicator as the sum of a true score and an error score. The term is 
closely linked to the latent variable/common factor model in that the true
score of a set of indicators are linear functions of some underlying common factor. 
Mathematically speaking, the correspondence is $\eta_{jk} = \lambda_{jk}\eta_j$  
where $\eta_{jk}$ is the true score and $\eta_j$ the underlying latent variable
Despite the difference, the term true score can generally be used synommenoulsy 
to the terms common factor and latent variable without risking a misunderstanding.
    
#### Proxy

Any quantity that functions as a representation of some other quantity.
Prominent proxies are the test score - which serves as a stand-in/proxy
for the true score - and the composite - which serves as a stand-in/proxy
for a common factor. 
Proxies are usually - but not necessarily - error-prone representations
of the quantity they seek to represent.

#### Stand-in

#### Structural Equation Modeling 

The entirety of a set of related theories, mathematical models, methods, 
algorithms and terminologies related to analyzing the relationships 
between (unobserved) concepts and/or observables.
