## The structural model

## The reflective measurement model
Define the general reflective measurement model as:
$$ x_{kj} = \eta_{kj} + \varepsilon_{kj} = \lambda_{kj}\eta_j +  \varepsilon_{kj}\quad\text{for}\quad k = 1, \dots, K_j\quad\text{and}\quad j = 1, \dots, J$$

Call $\eta_{kj} = \lambda_{kj}\eta_j$ the (indicator) true/population score and 
$\eta_j$ the underlying latent variable/construct supposed to be the common 
factor or cause of the $K_j$ indicators connected to latent variable $\eta_j$. 
Call $\lambda_{kj}$ the loading or direct effect of the latent variable on its indicator.
Let $x_{kj}$ be an indicator (observable), $\varepsilon_{kj}$ be a measurement error and  
$$\hat{\eta}_j = \sum^{K_j}_{k = 1} w_{kj} x_{kj} = \sum^{K_j}_{k = 1} w_{kj} \eta_{kj} + \sum^{K_j}_{k = 1} w_{kj} \varepsilon_{kj}
= \bar\eta_{kj} + \bar\varepsilon_{kj} = n_j\sum_{k=1}^{K_J}w_{kj}\lambda_{kj} + \bar\varepsilon_{kj}, $$ 
be a proxy/test score/composite/stand-in for/of $\eta_j$ based on observables, where $w_{kj}$ is a weight
to be determined and
$\bar\eta_k$ the proxy true score, i.e., a weighted sum of (indicator) true scores. 
Note the distinction betweeen the indicator true score $\eta_{kj}$ and the 
proxy true score which is the true score for $\hat\eta_k$ (i.e, the true score
of a score that is in fact a linear combination of (indicator) scores!)
We will usually simply refer to $\hat\eta$ as a "proxy" for $\eta_j$ as it stresses 
the fact that $\hat\eta_j$ is generally not the same as $\eta_j$ unless $\bar\varepsilon_{kj} = 0$
and $\sum_{k=1}^{K_J}w_{kj}\lambda_{kj} = 1$. 

Assume that $E(\varepsilon_{kj}) = E(\eta_j) = Cov(\eta_j, \varepsilon_{kj}) = 0$.
Further assume $Cov(\varepsilon_{kj}, \varepsilon_{lj})=0$ for $k \neq l$
and that $Var(\eta_j) = E(\eta^2_j) = 1$ to determine the scale. 

It often suffices to look at a generic test score/latent variable. For the sake of
clarity the index $j$ is therefore dropped unless it is necessary to avoid confusion. 

Note that most of the classical literature on quality criteria such as reliability
is centered around the idea that the proxy $\hat\eta_j$ is 
a in fact a simple sum score which implies that all weighs
are set to one. Treatment is more general here since $\hat{\eta}_j$ is allowed 
to be *any* weighted sum of related indicators. 
Readers familiar with the "classical treatment" may simply set weights 
to one (unit weights) to "translate" results to known formulae.

Based on the assumptions and definitions above the following quantities necessarily follow:
$$
\begin{align}
Cov(x_k, \eta) &= \lambda_k \\
Cor(x_k, \eta) &= \rho_{x_k, \eta} = \frac{\lambda_k}{\sqrt{Var(x_k)}} \\
Var(\eta_k) &= \lambda^2_k \\
Var(x_k)    &= \lambda^2_k + Var(\varepsilon_k) \\
Cov(\eta_k, \eta_l) &= E(\eta_k\eta_l) = \lambda_k\lambda_lE(\eta^2) = \lambda_k\lambda_l \\
Cov(x_k, x_j) &= \lambda_k\lambda_lE(\eta^2) + \lambda_kE(\eta\varepsilon_k) + \lambda_lE(\eta\varepsilon_l) + E(\varepsilon_k\varepsilon_l) = \lambda_k\lambda_l \\
Var(\hat\eta) &= \sum w_k^2(\lambda^2_k + Var(e_k)) + 2\sum_{k < l} w_k w_l \lambda_k\lambda_j = \bm{w}'\bm{\Sigma}\bm{w} \\
Var(\bar\eta) &= \sum w_k^2\lambda^2_k + 2\sum_{k < l} w_k w_l \lambda_k\lambda_j =(\sum w_k\lambda_k)^2 = (\bm{w}'\bm{\lambda})^2 \\
Cov(\eta, \hat\eta) &= E(\sum w_k \lambda_k \eta^2) = \sum w_k\lambda_k = \bm{w}'\bm{\lambda}= \sqrt{Var(\bar\eta)}
\end{align}
$$
where $\bm\Sigma$ is the indicator variance covariance matrix implied by the 
measurement model:

$$
\bm\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda^2_1 + Var(\varepsilon_1) & \lambda_1\lambda_2  & \dots & \lambda_1\lambda_K \\
\lambda_2\lambda_ 1 & \lambda^2_2 + Var(\varepsilon_2) & \dots & \lambda_2\lambda_K \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\lambda_{K}\lambda_1 & \lambda_K\lambda_2 &\dots &\lambda^2_K + Var(\varepsilon_K)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

In `cSEM` indicators are always standardized (i.e., $Var(x_k) = 1$) and weights 
are always appropriately scaled such that the variance of $\hat\eta$ is equal 
to one! For some formulae this implies a significant simplification, 
however, for ease of 
comparison to extant literature formulae for quality criteria such as 
reliability or the average variance extracted will be derived and written in
general form. The "simplified form" or "cSEM form" using $Var(x_k) = Var(\hat\eta) = 1$ 
will be given at the end of each paragraph.
