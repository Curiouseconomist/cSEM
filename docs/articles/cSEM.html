<div id="preface" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#preface" class="anchor"></a>Preface</h1>
<p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been used for over a century across a multitude of research fields such as (among others) psychology, sociology, or business research.</p>
<p>As an almost inevidable consequence, a different terminology system and a distinct mathematical notation has evolved within each field over the years. This “terminology mess” is one of the major obstacles in interdisciplinary research and (scientific) debates, hampers a broader understanding of methodolocial issues, and, even worse, promotes systematic missue (e.g. the use of Cronbach’s alpha as an estimator for congeneric reliability). This is particulary true for those new to SEM or casual applied users who are often overwhelmed by terminology of their own field only to find that the term they just thought to have finally grasped is definied differently in another field, making the confusion complete.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a matter of (mis)communication which, in our opinion, can only be satisfactorily solved by establishing a clear, unambigious definition for each term and symbol that is used within the package. We emphasize that we do not seek to impose “our” conventions, nor do we claim they are the “correct” convention, but merly seek to make communication between us (the authors of the package) and you (the package user) as unambigious and error-free as possible.</p>
<p>This introduction therefore provides two glossaries:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <a href="#terminology">termionology glossary</a> containing each term that we think should be definied and explained in order to make sure package users understand complementary help files or vignettes the way the package authors intended them to be understood.</li>
<li>The <a href="#notation">mathematical notation glossary</a> containing each mathematical symbol used in the package documentation alongside a definition.</li>
</ol>
<p>The package is designed based on a set of principles that are partly in contrast to common open-source or commerical software offering similar content. This introduction serves to explain these principles, to contrast them to existing software, and to point readers to further reading. Lastly, to use <strong>cSEM</strong> effectively, it is helpful to understand its design. Hence, the package architecure and design as well as what we consider the “cSEM workflow” is discussed.</p>

<div id="composite-based-structural-equation-modeling" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#composite-based-structural-equation-modeling" class="anchor"></a>Composite-based structural equation modeling</h1>
<div id="what-is-structural-equation-modeling-sem" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#what-is-structural-equation-modeling-sem" class="anchor"></a>What is structural equation modeling (SEM)</h2>
<p><a href="#terminology">Structural equation modeling (SEM)</a> is about modeling the (causal) relationship between <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> (an entity defined by a conceptual definition, e.g. “emotional stability”, “self-confidence”, “customer loyalty”) with other <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> and/or observable quantities generally referred to as indicators, manifest variables or items. Broadly speaking, two modeling approaches exist. We refer to the first as <a href="#lvmodel">the latent variable model</a> and to the second as <a href="#cmodel">the composite model</a>. Each approach entails a set of methods, estimators, test, and evaluation criteria as well as a specific terminology that may or may not be adequate within the realm of the other approach.</p>
<div id="lvmodel" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#lvmodel" class="anchor"></a>The latent variable or common factor model</h3>
<p>Assuming there are <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> indicators, the fundamental feature of the latent variable model is the assumption of the existence of a set of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> <a href="#terminology">latent variables (common factors)</a> that each serve as a representation of one of the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> to be studied in a sense that each <a href="#terminology">latent variable</a> is at least partly (causally) responsible for the manifestations of a set of indicators which are supposed to measure the <a href="#terminology">concept</a> in question. The entirety of these measurement relations is captured by the <strong>measurement model</strong> which relates indicators to <a href="#terminology">latent variables</a> according to the researchers theory of how observables are related to the <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> in question. The entirety of the relationships between <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> (i.e., its representation the <a href="#terminology">construct</a>) is captured by the <strong>structural model</strong> whose parameters are usually at the center of the researchers interest. Caution is warranted though as the <a href="#terminology">common factor</a> and its respective <a href="#terminology">concept</a> are not the same thing. Within the covariance-based literature <a href="#terminology">concept</a>, <a href="#terminology">construct</a>, <a href="#terminology">latent variable</a> and its representation the <a href="#terminology">common factor</a> have often been used interchangeably <span class="citation">(Rigdon 2012, 2016; Rigdon, Becker, and Sarstedt 2019)</span>. This will not be the case here and readers are explicitly made aware of the fact that <a href="#terminology">concepts</a> are the abstract entity which <em>may</em> be modeled by a <a href="#terminology">common factor</a>, however, no assertion as to the correctness of this approach in terms of “closeness of the <a href="#terminology">common factor</a> and its related <a href="#terminology">concept</a>” are made.</p>
<p>Parameters in latent variable models are usually retrieved by (full-information) maximum likelihood. The idea is to find parameters such that the difference between the model-implied and the empirical indicator covariance matrix is minimized. Such estimation methods are therefore usually refered to as covariance-based methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="cmodel" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#cmodel" class="anchor"></a>The composite model</h3>
<p>The second approach is known as the composite model. As opposed to the latent variable or common factor model, composite do not presuppose the existence of a latent variable. Hence, designed entities (artifacts) such as the “OECD Better Life Index” that arguably have no latent counterpart may be adequatly described by a composite, i.e the linear combination of observables defining the composite. Composites may also be formed to represent latent variables/common factor (or more precisely a concepts modeled as a common factors) in which case the composite serves as a proxy or stand-in for the the latent variable. However, in cSEM, the term “composite model” is only used to refer to a model in a the former sense, i.e. a model in which the composite is a direct representation of concept/construct!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="what-is-composite-based-sem" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#what-is-composite-based-sem" class="anchor"></a>What is composite-based SEM?</h2>
<p>Composite-based SEM is the entirety of methods, approaches, procedures, algorithms that in some way or another involve linear compounts (composites), i.e. linear combinations of observables when retriving (estimating) quantities of interest such as the coefficents of the structural model. Its is important to clearly distiguish between the composite model and what we call composite-based SEM. They are not the same. While the former is “only” <em><strong>a</strong></em> <em>model</em> relating concepts to observables, the latter simply states that composites (linear compounts, i.e. (weighted linear combinations of observables) are used to retrive quantities of interest, given a specific modeling approach! Hence, composite-based SEM thus covers common factor as well as composite models!</p>
<p>As sketched above, common factor and composite models fundamentally differ in how the relation between observables and concepts is modeled. Naturally, results and, most notably, their (correct/meaningful) interpretation critically hinge on what type of model the user specifies. Across the package we therefore strictly distigusih between</p>
<ul>
<li>Concepts modeled as common factors (or alternatively latent variables)</li>
<li>Concepts modeled as composites</li>
</ul>
<p>These phrases will repeateatly appear in help files and other complementary files. It is therefore crucial to remember what they supposed to convey.</p>

<div id="model-vs-estimation" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#model-vs-estimation" class="anchor"></a><strong>Model vs. Estimation</strong>
</h3>
<p>The way different concepts and their relationship are <em>modeled</em> is strictly distinct from how they are <em>estimated</em>. Hence we strictly distinguish between concepts modeled as common factors (or composites) and the actual estimation for <strong>a given model</strong>.</p>
<p>In cSEM we make use of the lavaan model syntax but redefine the operator <code>&lt;~</code> to mean that the concept to its left is modeled as a composite (not a formative common factor). The operator <code>=~</code> is used to mean that the concept to its left is modeled as a common factor.</p>

<a href="#composites-in-a-composite-model-vs-composite-in-a-common-factor-model-and-disattenuation" class="anchor"></a><strong>Composites in a composite model vs. composite in a common factor model and disattenuation</strong>
</h3>
<p>By virtue of the package, cSEM uses composite-based estimators only. Depending on the model choosen, linear compounts may therefore either serve as a composite as part of the composite model or as a proxy/stand-in for a common factor. If a concept is modeled as a common factor, proxy correlations, proxy-indicator correlations and path coeffcients are inconsistent estimates for their supposed construct level counterparts (construct correlations, loadings and path coefficients) unless the proxy is a perfect representation of its construct level counterpart. This is commonly refered to as <strong>attentuation bias</strong>.<br>
Several approaches have been suggested to correct for these biases. In cSEM estimates are correctly dissattenuated by default if any of the concepts involved are modeled as a common factor! Disattentuation is controlled by the <code>.disattenuate</code> argument of <code><a href="../reference/csem.html">csem()</a></code></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">model &lt;-<span class="st"> "</span></a>

<p>Note that since <code>.approach_weights = "PLS-PM"</code> and <code>.disattentuate = TRUE</code> by default (see for <a href="#roleofpls">The role of the weightning scheme and partial least squares (PLS)</a> below) and one of the concepts in the model above is modeled as a common factor, composite (proxy) correlations, loadings and path coefficients are adequately disattenuated using the correction approach commonly known as <strong>consistent partial least squares (PLSc)</strong>. If <code>.disattenuate = FALSE</code> or all concepts are modeled as composites “proper” PLS values are returned. To learn more about disattenuation, see the Methods and Formulae section of the respective weightning approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="roleofpls" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#roleofpls" class="anchor"></a><strong>The role of the weightning scheme and partial least squares (PLS)</strong>
</h3>
<p>In principal, any weighted combination of appropriately choosen observables can be used to estimate structural relationships between these compounts. Hence, any conceptual or methodological issue disscussed based on a composite build by a given (weightning) approach may equally well be discussed for any other potential weightning scheme. The appropriatness or potential superiority of a specific weightning approach such as “unit weights” (sum scores) over another such as “partial least squares path modeling” (PLS) is therfore to some extent a question of <em>relative</em> appropriatness and <em>relative</em> superiority.</p>
<p>As a notable consequence, we belief that well known approach such partial least squares path modeling (PLS) and generalized structured component analysis (GSCA) are - contrary to common belief - best exclusivly understood as prescriptions for forming linear compunts based on observables, i.e. as weightning approaches. In cSEM this is reflected by the fact that <code>"PLS"</code> and <code>"GSCA"</code> are choices of the <code>.approach_weights</code> argument.</p>

<p>The entirety of a set of related theories, mathematical models, methods, algorithms and terminologies related to analyzing the relationships between (unobserved) concepts and/or observables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Concept</dt>
<dd>
<p>An entity defined by a conceptual definition. In line with Rigdon (2016) we call variables representing or subsuming a concept <strong>conceptual variables</strong>. The precise nature/meaning of a conceptual variable depends on “differnt assumptions, philosophies or worldviews [of the researcher]” (Rigdon, 2016, p. 2). Unless otherwise stated, it is sufficient for our purpose to think of concepts as entities that exist simply because they have been defined. Hence, abstract terms such as “loyalty” or “depression” as well as designed entities (artifacts) such as the “OECD Better Life Index” are covered by the definition.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Construct</dt>
<dd>
<p>Construct may refer to a representation of a concept within a given statistical model. While a concept is defined by a conceptual (theoretical) definition, a construct for a concept is defined/created by how the researcher’s operationalization. As opposed to concepts, constructs therefore exist because they arise as the result of the act of modeling their relation to the observable variables (indicators). As such, stand-ins cease to exist without a measurement model and are inherently tied to the postulated measurement relation and consequently to the data as represented by the indicators. Hence, stand-ins do not necessarily represent the concept they are meant to represent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Proxy</dt>
<dd>
<p>A stand-in</p>
</dd>
<dt>Common factor</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common factor is a type of construct. The defining feature of a common factor is the idea that the common factor is the common underlying cause of the realizations of a set of indicators that are said to measure the common factor. The common factor model is also referred to as reflective measurement model. Accordingly, indicators related to the common factor are modeled as measurement error-prone manifestations of a common variable, cause or factor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Latent variable</dt>
<dd>
<p>Although, there a conceptional differences, We use the terms common factor and latent variable synommenoulsy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Composite</dt>
<dd>
<p>A composite is a weighted sum of its related indicators. Composites may either serve as constructs or as proxies for . The nature of the composite is defined by the type of (measurement) model. If composites are error-free representations of a concept we refer to the measurement model as composite measurement. If composites are used as stand-ins, the measurement model is called causal-formative (Henseler, 2017)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Factor-based methods</dt>
<dd>
<p>Factor-based methods or factor-based SEM refers to the entirety of methods centered around the use as of the common factors as stand-ins for the concepts under investigation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Composite-based methods</dt>
<dd>
<p>Composite-based methods or composite-based SEM refers to the entirety of methods centered around the use as of composites (linear compounts of observables) as stand-ins or error-free representations for the concepts under investigation.</p>
